# GC Summary

This is a silly project for tracking character progression in the online MMO Grand Chase Classic and generating a cool printable/shareable image from it.

I developed this project as an experiment on Vibe Coding. The code (aside from initial setup) was 100% generated with prompts on Cursor.

Spoiler Alert: This is the worst codebase ever. 

While it does technically work, the code quickly devolved into a super complex and impossible to maintain setup with tones of nested arrays within nested arrays of objects containing more arrays.

I approached this from a "what would a complete tech oblivious person do" point of view (well kinda, since I still picked the tooling, did the project setup, etc). I gave the AI no directions on how to implement anything, just kept piling requirements on requirements to see what would happen.

If I had to do any actual maintenance on this codebase I think I would just throw it away and rebuild it from scratch.

With all that said, it's still a fun tool that I made in an afternoon to share with my guildmates (it beats our previous google docs setup lol)
